for Loop
Syntax
for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
  // code
}


The for loop consists of three optional expressions, followed by a code block:

initialization - This expression runs before the execution of the first loop, and is usually used to create a counter.
condition - This expression is checked each time before the loop runs. If it evaluates to true, the statement or code in the loop is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops. And if this expression is omitted, it automatically evaluates to true.
finalExpression - This expression is executed after each iteration of the loop. This is usually used to increment a counter, but can be used to decrement a counter instead.



Examples
Iterate through integers from 0-8:
for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8


for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Output:
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
